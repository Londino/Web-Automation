# Web Automation in Ruby using WATIR & Rspec frameworks.

This is a work-based project I have been working on at my current job and is aimed at demonstrating my scripting abilities at web automation.

## This repo serves demo/educational purposes only and all/any sensitive information included in the original script has been removed.

The aim of the script is to automate a regression test plan consisting of 100+ scenarios that was previously being executed manually. Time to commpletion when manually executed: 4+ hours. Time to completion when automated: ~16'.
